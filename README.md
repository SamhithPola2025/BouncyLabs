# BouncyLabs
A very simple 2D physics engine built in C++!

---

## Features

- Real-time 2d physics simulation
- Gravity, wind and friction effects
- Collision detection and resolution:
    - Particle-to-particle
    - Square-to-square
    - Triangle-to-square
    - Triangle-to-triangle
- Shape constraints (e.g., squares and triangles maintain their structure)
- Interactive controls using ImGui:
    - Create and delete particles, squares, and triangles
    - Adjust gravity, wind, and other parameters
    - Pause and resume the simulation
- Written in modern C++ with a focus on simplicity and performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later (e.g., `g++`, `clang`)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (for building the project)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (for window management)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) (for OpenGL function loading)
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (for the user interface)

---

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamhithPola2025/BouncyLabs.git
cd BouncyLabs
```
2. Navigate to the build directory:
```bash
cd build
```
3. Run CMake to configure the project:
```bash
cmake ..
make
./BouncyLabs
```

### Or, you can simply download the release in releases, the above steps are only if you dont have a MACOS system.
